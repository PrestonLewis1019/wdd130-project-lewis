            <h1>Glucose Monitor</h1>
            <p>This is a CGM or continuous glucose monitor. This allows you to not use a glucose monitor as much but you will still use it. The CGM is a great tool for parents and the Diabetic to use because it constantly chec\ks you blood sugar throughout the day. It also allows you to always know what your sugar is when you want to check it. </p>

        <div class="section2">
            <h1>Pump</h1>
            <p>This is a pump it replaces the daily injections that many diabetics must do. The reason diabetics like this is because pumps are now able to connect to the CGM and display your sugars on your pump. Not only that but it can depend on the pump you have and if the CGM is able to connect to it. It can automatically give you the insulin that you need to lower your sugar. </p>
